		<h1> The time is now </h1>
		<h2> Moloko </h2>
		<div> <pre>

You're my last breathe xxxxxx 
You're a breathe of fresh air to me 
I'm empty
So tell me you care for me 
		
You're the first thing 
And the last thing on my mind 
In your arms I feel 
Sunshine 

On a promise 
A day dream yet to come 
Time is upon us 
Oh but the night is young

Flowers blossom 
In the winter time 
In your arms I feel 
Sunshine 

Give up yourself unto the moment 
The time is now 
Give up yourself unto the moment 
Let's make this moment last 

You may find yourself 
Out on a limb for me 
Could you expect it as 
A part of your destiny
